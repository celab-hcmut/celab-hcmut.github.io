### Topic
**Display subsystem on FPGA: from hardware to software**

### Introduction

#### Goals:
1. To help readers have the most basic understanding of the implementation of display on FPGA and display driver on Linux kernel.
2. To help readers gain basic knowledge about Linux kernel.

#### Brief:
1. Display technologies on Linux: FBDEV, DRM/KMS, V4L2.
2. Why do we choose DRM/KMS (Direct Render Manager/Kernel Mode Setting)? Because of its stability and variable of features.
3. 5 components of DRM/KMS: Framebuffer, CRTC, Plane, Encoder, Connector.
4. Hardware implementation on FPGA and software development.
5. What is X11? It is a protocol allowing applications to create objects such as windows and use basic drawing primitives.
6. Future plans:
    - Hardware development of GPU IP Core and Linux kernel driver development for it (12 months).
    - Integrate H264 or H265 IP core and develop Linux kernel driver for it (4 months).
    - Ubuntu rootfs porting to replace the Petalinux rootfs (on going).
