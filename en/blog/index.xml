Introduction The following boards are mentioned PYNQ-Z1, Zturn-7020, Ultra96-v1/v2 within the presentation. Goals:
To help engineers understand how the display subsystem works for Linux. Basic steps to create a design with display integrated (hardware, software, debugging). Bonus: extending the system with GPU, display port over USB, Vitis-AI (theory only).
